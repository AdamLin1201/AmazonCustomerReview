I don't have anything against them personally but the endless annoying and trashy infomercials and the fact that a lot of their older vacuums sucked beyond belief, I honestly am not too thrilled with them as a company.\\n\\nA few years ago I got a Bissell Pet Hair Eraser vacuum, model 3920, and very quickly became disappointed with it.  It sucked well, but within minutes the plastic piece at the top, the one responsible for making the airflow rotate got clogged up with fur and the suction went down dramatically.  Emptying the dust cup was the worst part of it, it made a horrible mess all over the place.  I suffered with that vacuum for a couple years and ...</td>\n",

I was mildly disappointed with a couple of noticeable differences. First of all, when the beater brush was on in the older vac, it would just pull me along with such great power. I felt like it was effortless. This new van doesn't do that. I have to use some strength to push it,. Secondly, when I use the wand, I feel like it should be a bit longer. I have to bend over just a little to reach the floor. So for those two reasons, I end up with a sore back when I'm done vacuuming. Also, the older versio...</td>\n",

I hate sending stuff to the land fill, but there it goes. The first thing I noticed, obviously, was the weight. The Shark is much lighter than the old Hoover. Second, I also noticed that the head of the machine (with the brushes and all) was much less wide than the old Hoover. At first that was a tad concerning. But once I started vacuuming I quickly warmed up to the Shark. Next, I was surprised at how easy it was to maneuver. The Hoover had a power assist (something I never liked and always turned off; that made it hard to push around on thick carpet).

I don't have anything against them personally but the endless annoying and trashy infomercials and the fact that a lot of their older vacuums sucked beyond belief, I honestly am not too thrilled with them as a company.\\n\\nA few years ago I got a Bissell Pet Hair Eraser vacuum, model 3920, and very quickly became disappointed with it.  It sucked well, but within minutes the plastic piece at the top, the one responsible for making the airflow rotate got clogged up with fur and the suction went down dramatically.  Emptying the dust cup was the worst part of it, it made a horrible mess all over the place.  I suffered with that vacuum for a couple years and ...   \n",
       "1     Like most, I was reluctant to buy this vacuum due to the Shark brand and how heavily they're pushed on infomercials. But after using the vac there are a lot of things I like about it. However, all the good things that I like are waging a battle in my brain with how damn ugly and cheap this thing looks. The pictures don't translate how bad the shiny red and silver chrome \"plating\" is. Oh well, at least it performs.\\n\\nLike a few others, I bought the Dyson DC41 to compare. I bought the Dyson the same day, opened it up and literally used it right next to the Shark. I went around the entire house and did parallel sweeps of all the large areas to get equal samples. I spent the same amount of time and went the same amount of distance with each. I then emptied each bin onto separate paper tow...   \n",
       "2     I have to say I am really impressed. I have had a Dyson for years. Like everyone who owns a Dyson, you think the expensive price tag equals quality. Most of the time this is true.

He referred me to a website that does third party testing on vacuum cleaners. This unit was the highest rated among canister vacuums. There a many which have better ratings but I will not buy a vacuum that uses bags.\\n\\nI opened the box and I was really pleased with the ease of assembly.

I read reviews of the canister being too heavy- but that is why the vacuum included the Caddy to drag around. I live in a house with a lot of hardwood floors. This vacuum has helped elimate my need to sweep several times a day.

       "5     Actually, it's got more features than I need.  I think.  I'm not really sure.  Do I need my upright to be able to convert to a canister vacuum?  I guess if I want to use to to clean the inside of my truck, then the answer is \"yes\".  I was torn between this $219 Shark, and a $599 Dyson.  I posted the question on Facebook.  The Dysons got good reviews 80% of the time, and horrible reviews the other 20, all because of reliability.  Everyone that has a Shark loves it.  I checked Consumer Reports, and the Shark rated higher.  It also rates higher on Amazon.  So, I bought this very versatile, extremely powerful, Shark.  When I told our maid (why didn't I ask her before I bought it's?), she was thrilled.  Many of her clients have Dysons, and she doesn't care for them.  One has a Shark, and sh...   \n",
       "6     After reading reviews for the Dyson and Shark Rotator for weeks I went with the Rotator, more specifically the NV502 model found at Bed Bath & Beyond.

Also, I have two daughters with long hair.... I was surprised when I tipped it over to look at the rollers. My Dyson NEVER had this problem. I've attached a photo of the hair that wrapped around the roller. Also, it's not that great on hardwood or tile floors. It does no pick up the dirt that lines the baseboard. I literally have to sweep it to the middle of the floor and then vacuum, or use the hose to get it. I might have to bite the bullet and invest in another Dyson.... Ugh!   \n",

       "10    I've had this vacuum for 2.5 years (2013) and I purchased it from Target for $169.  We have two kids and several animals.  We used to have a Eureka with a bag but the new carpet was too thick and was burning out the motor on the Eureka.  This Shark vacuum (NV341) is very nice.  It vacuums up considerably more hair/dirt than the bag vacuum.  Essentially, I vacuum 3 times a week a 1300 sq ft house and often the dust cup is half to full after each vacuuming event.  I think the bag on the Eureka would have exploded after about a week, so I feel that our home is much cleaner.

I don't really expect this to be an issue, but it was hard not to notice. I can say that I really like the functionality of this vacuum - how you can just use the handle or the wand extension, how the wand comes out, etc. The exception to this is the cord clip - I forget the cord is attached to the wand and it's a bit of a hassle, but as a work-around I stopped using the clip and I just drape the cord over the arm that the cord get's stored on.

I tried to exchange it but amazons website said I had to do that by 10/2 ( I just received it on 9/2). You would think for almost $200 that it would work for more than 30 days.  This is the first and last shark I will ever buy.   \n",
       "15    I have always hated how stiff the accessory hose is on my Dyson, and the fact that the machine falls over when you use it.  Unfortunately, this machine does the same thing.  I don't understand why these high-end vacuum designers can't seem to create one that has a convenient and stable system for using the attachment that everyone needs for getting around the edges of walls and furniture.  This feature should not be an afterthought.  I like that it is small and can get around furniture easily, but thank goodness it's a fairly light machine because to use it, you are essentially lifting the body of the vacuum the entire time you are vacuuming.  It's hard to explain, but with other vacuums, you lean the handle back and the center of gravity is more forward, so it's still standing up on i...   \n",
       "16    In 2014 I bought this vacuum, Shark Shark Rotator Professional Lift-Away (NV501), and I loved it so much. I actually looked forward to vacuuming. But we had a house fire in October 2015 and lost everything. We finally got back into our rebuilt home. I couldn't wait to buy this vacuum again. I was mildly disappointed with a couple of noticeable differences. First of all, when the beater brush was on in the older vac, it would just pull me along with such great power. I felt like it was effortless. This new van doesn't do that. I have to use some strength to push it,. Secondly, when I use the wand, I feel like it should be a bit longer. I have to bend over just a little to reach the floor. So for those two reasons, I end up with a sore back when I'm done vacuuming. Also, the older versio...   \n",

The 3rd time I used it I ran over the cord with the vacuum and it broke the plastic coating so I had to put electrical tape over it. I have had it for 1 year and it over heats and smells like burnt rubber and wont turn on. I have to wait 20 mins for it to work again. I had to buy a new Vacuum and I went back to Kenmore.   \n",
       "18    This vacuum replaces an old and heavy Hoover Wind Tunnel model. I tried to repair the Hoover, but the parts are no longer available. I hate sending stuff to the land fill, but there it goes. The first thing I noticed, obviously, was the weight. The Shark is much lighter than the old Hoover. Second, I also noticed that the head of the machine (with the brushes and all) was much less wide than the old Hoover. At first that was a tad concerning. But once I started vacuuming I quickly warmed up to the Shark. Next, I was surprised at how easy it was to maneuver. The Hoover had a power assist (something I never liked and always turned off; that made it hard to push around on thick carpet). But the Shark was very easy to push around, and the ball pivot head really makes maneuvering around fur...   \n",

       "21    Three years ago we purchased a Dyson vacuum that was nearly $600 and thought we had a killer deal. Unfortunately, the vacuum seemed to overheat all the time. What we discovered was that as you cleaned, the filters filled with dust and would cause the motor to get hot. Now, you might think we needed to empty the dustbin more often, but this happened with EVERY cleaning of the carpet. Didn't matter if we cleaned the filters thoroughly before, the unit could not do our whole carpet (normal sized house) without shutting down from heat 'exhaustion'.\\n\\nOur daughter purchased a Shark the same time we got the Dyson and never had a problem.

So, I was ready to try something completely different.\\n\\nI researched this Shark and read good things about it.  Since it cost so much less than the Dyson, I decided to try it. I absolutely LOVE it.  It's very lightweight and easy to maneuver. Since it doesn't have Dyson's enormous ball, it easily slides beneath my sofa and other low-lying furniture. A button next to the power switch converts it back and forth from carpet to bare floor. For bare floor, the brush quits spinning, so you don't have dirt and sand ...   \n",

       "24    Let me start by saying that I really liked how this vacuum worked on my old carpet. However we just purchased new carpet which has denser pile. The problem is since there is no height adjustment  you can't push this on denser carpet. I was also told by the person at the carpet store that without a height adjustment it would wear out even the most durable carpet since the beater bar is so low. I called Shark customer service but since I purchased it over a month ago I couldn't return it.I was willing to return it and purchase a more expensive model with an adjustment but since I had it for 40 days I was past the return date.

We tried it on the carpeted stairs and it worked really well. It has plenty of power and suction. I am excited to use this machine on our floors and also furniture too. I love that it is a lift away.

       "26    So far, so good. I've used it 3 times to vaccum my whole downstairs. I have all tile and hardwood. It doesn't seem to leave anything behind from what I can tell. It's very heavy, but moves smoothly. The cord is long enough for me. It stays upright and doesn't fall over for me like other reviewers have said. The attachments are very handy and I've already used all of them (for the couch, under the couch, baseboards, area rugs, etc.) The vaccum is way too powerful to work on area rugs, I have to use an attachment and even that it rough on it, which just means good suction so can't complain.

This particular model did not come with dust away attachment which is absolutely the best for hardwood floors.  I called Shark and they shipped me one at no cost.  The company I bought this through on Amazon did a great job.  I received the vacuum in less time than predicted and everything was great.

       "1877  I bought this vacuum (NV 502) model based on reviews. I couldn't be happier about its attachments and the choice to use it as a canister, upright or even carry it around. Once I plugged it I realized this vacuum is so quiet because there is no suction!!! I am so disappointed, I will definitely return it. My European experience is completely different. Nothing is sold without the power suction information (in Watts). A good vacuum cleaner sticks to the floor while working and requires some serious effort to pick it up, not to mention that if by accident a piece of fabric is close to the vacuum someone would need two hands to get it out!! Yes, you can roll the vacuum on the floor and no hair or dust is left behind. A fair price for 1200 Watts like Shark is less than 120 Euros. My Europea...   \n",

Avoid these at any cost if YOU are allergic to dust and pet dander.  Yeah, this Shark works great -until I empty it!!!   \n",
